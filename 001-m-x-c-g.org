* All The Shortcuts Are Grey

There is the myth that Emacs is hard because of the astonishing amount
of its shortcuts. Here's my trick: there are only 2 shortcuts you have
to know by heart:

| Shortcut | Purpose                   |
|----------+---------------------------|
| =Alt-x=  | Run any command           |
| =Ctrl-g= | Cancel what you are doing |

=Alt-x= is equivalent to VS Code's =Ctrl+Shift+p=: it opens a command
palette from which to run any of the available commands.\\
Try:

| Do                      | Comment                                               |
|-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------|
| Open Emacs              |                                                       |
| Hit =Alt-x=             | The focus moves to a 1-line input area in the bottom. |
| Type =dired-jump= there | Like the shell, you can use =TAB= to complete.        |
| Hit =Return=            |                                                       |

This will show the content of the current directory.\\
Close it with:

| Do                 | Comment                            |
|--------------------+------------------------------------|
| Hit =Alt-x=        | Display the command palette again. |
| Type =quit-window= |                                    |
| Hit =Return=       |                                    |

If you find yourself stuck, =Ctrl-g= is your friend.

Everything in Emacs is a command: saving files, committing to Git, etc.
Even typing a single character is a command you can run with =Alt-x=.\\
Indeed, =Alt-x= is your passe-partout shortcut.

** From now on
Here's a minimal set of commands to get started:

| Command                      | Purpose                              |
|------------------------------+--------------------------------------|
| =find-file=                  | Open a file or a directory           |
| =save-buffer=                | Save the displayed content to a file |
| =save-buffers-kill-terminal= | Quit Emacs                           |

For the rest, just use:

- Arrow keys, Page Up, Page Down, Start and End to move.
- =Backspace= and =Del= to delete.

Some keys won't work as you think (e.g., =Ctrl-c=, =Ctrl-v=, =Ctrl-a=,
=Ctrl-s=, =Ctrl-z=). You'll soon get to them. Just don't use them just
yet.

Remember, if stuck, =Ctrl-g=.

** Completion
Like with the shell, use =TAB= to complete commands. Hit =TAB= twice
to display a list of candidates.

Shortly, you will make this command palette way more powerful.

** Emacs Lingo
Get familiar with the Emacs parlance. I will use it from now on:

| Original form                                     | In Emacs lingo       | Notes                                             |
|---------------------------------------------------+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------|
| =Alt-x=                                           | =M-x=                | Pronounced *Meta X*                               |
| =Ctrl-g=                                          | =C-g=                |                                                   |
| Hit =Alt-x=, type =dired-jump=, then hit =Return= | =M-x dired-jump RET= |                                                   |
| Shortcut                                          | Key Binding          |                                                   |
| Displayed content                                 | Buffer               | Any content, even if not displayed, is "a buffer" |
| Command palette                                   | Minibuffer           |                                                   |
| To open a file                                    | To visit a file      |                                                   |
