There is a famous article titled [[https://emacsen.org/2009/07/learn-emacs-in-ten-years][Learn Emacs In Ten Years]]. Its main
takeaway is that Emacs will accompany you for decades and you will
never cease learning from it.

This does not mean that learning Emacs is a Herculean task. On the
contrary: not only is Emacs simpler than you think, it is also
self-documenting. Indeed, this book is only a primer. For every
functionality you want to learn, ask Emacs itself for help.

As usual, =M-x= is your best friend. Use it to invoke one of the
=describe-*= commands. Try yourself: type =M-x describe-= and discover
how many of them there are. The most important are:

| Command             | For example                                                                              |
|---------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =describe-command=  | =M-x describe-command RET blink-cursor-mode RET=                                         |
| =describe-variable= | =M-x describe-variable RET user-init-file=                                               |
| =describe-package=  | =M-x describe-package RET vertico RET=                                                   |
| =describe-key=      | =M-x describe-key RET <then type C-s>= to find out that =C-s= is not for saving.         |
| =describe-mode=     | =M-x describe-mode RET= to discover all the current available key bindings and features. |


Notice from the candidate list the key bindings: they all start with
=C-h=, which stands for /help/.

| Command             | Key binding |
|---------------------+-------------|
| =describe-command=  | =C-h x=     |
| =describe-variable= | =C-h v=     |
| =describe-package=  | =C-h P=     |
| =describe-key=      | =C-h k=     |
| =describe-mode=     | =C-h m=     |

Do I need to repeat? Don't feel compelled to learn them.

Documentation is always displayed in a separate window. You know how
to focus it (Shift + arrow keys) and how to close it (=C-x 0=, but you
can also just type =q= to quit).

Notice that if you run =M-x describe-variable RET= while your cursor
is on a variable, it will suggest that variable as the first
candidate. Same for commands. This is one of the several incarnations
of the famous Do What I Mean (DWIM) approach of Emacs: Emacs often
tries to read your mind.

Also notice that those doc pages are interactive. =describe-package=
offers a button to uninstall the package.

And, finally, notice that this is dynamically generated documentation:
=describe-command= lists the key bindings associated to a command. If
you modify or add one, the documentation will be automatically
updated. Neat.

Good read.
