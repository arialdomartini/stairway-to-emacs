Each chapter:

- Is short enough to fit a single rock song.
- Is, in most cases, independent from the others.


** Why?
I'm convinced that there are only 2 hard things in Emacs:

1. Getting started. There is an embarassingly steep initial step, and
   not enough noob-proof ways to overtake it.
2. Getting finished: Emacs is a programmable environment, not an
  editor, and there are literally no limits to it. 

This book aims to help with 1 only --- and hopefully to let you
fall ethernally in the 2nd trap.
