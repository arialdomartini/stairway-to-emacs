This book will not teach you everything on Emacs: it's a short
tutorial whose goal is to help you gain authonomy on exploring and
learning Emacs with your own strengths.

Each chapter:

- Is short enough to fit the time of a single rock song.
- One each day, at a sustanaible pace, gives you both relentless
  progress and the time to do your stuff.

** Why?
I'm convinced that there are only 2 hard things in Emacs:

1. Getting started. There is an embarassingly steep initial step, and
   not enough noob-proof ways to overtake it.
2. Getting finished: Emacs is a programmable environment, not an
  editor, and there are literally no limits to it. 

This book aims to help you with 1 only --- and hopefully to let you
fall in the trap of the 2nd, eternally.

** How?

- You will build your Emacs configuration from the scratch.
- Whenever bored, you can always switch to an out-of-the-box
  distribution such as [[doom][Doom Emacs]] or [[spacemacs][(spacemacs)]].
- I will provide easy instructions, but you will still need to
  challenge yourself getting your hands dirty.
