Each chapter:

- Is short enough to fit the time of a single rock song.
- Is, in most cases, independent from the others.
  
** Why?
I'm convinced that there are only 2 hard things in Emacs:

1. Getting started. There is an embarassingly steep initial step, and
   not enough noob-proof ways to overtake it.
2. Getting finished: Emacs is a programmable environment, not an
  editor, and there are literally no limits to it. 

This book aims to help you with 1 only --- and hopefully to let you
fall in the trap of the 2nd, eternally.

** How?

- You will build your Emacs configuration from the scratch.
- Whenever bored, you can always switch to an out-of-the-box
  distributions such as [[doom][Doom Emacs]] or [[spacemacs][(spacemacs)]].
- I will provide easy instructions, but you will still need to
  challenge yourself getting your hands dirty.
