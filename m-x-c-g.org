* All The Shortcuts Are Grey

There is the myth that Emacs is hard because of the astonishing amount
of its shortcuts. Here's my trick: there are only 2 shortcuts you have
to know by heart:

| Shortcut | Purpose                   |
|----------+---------------------------|
| =Alt-X=  | Run any command           |
| =Ctrl-G= | Cancel what you are doing |

=M-x= is equivalent to VS Code's =Ctrl+Shift+P=: it opens a command
palette from which to run any of the available commands.\\
Try:

| Do                      | Comment                                               |
|-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------|
| Open Emacs              |                                                       |
| Hit =Alt-X=             | The focus moves to a 1-line input area in the bottom. |
| Type =dired-jump= there | Like the shell, you can use =TAB= to complete.        |
| Hit =Return=       |                                                       |

This will show the content of the current directory.\\
Close it with:

* Hit =Alt-X=.
* type =quit-window=.
* Hit =Return=.

If you find yourself stuck, =Ctrl-G= is your friend.

Everything in Emacs is a command: saving files, committing to Git, and
even typing a single character.\\
=Alt-X= is your passe-partout shortcut.

** From now on
Here's a minimal set of commands to get started:

| Command                      | Purpose                              |
|------------------------------+--------------------------------------|
| =find-file=                  | Open a file or a directory           |
| =save-buffer=                | Save the displayed content to a file |
| =save-buffers-kill-terminal= | Quit Emacs                           |

For the rest, just use:

- Arrow keys, Page Up, Page Down, Start and End to move.
- =Canc= and =Del= to delete.

Some keys won't work as you think (e.g., =Ctrl-C=, =Ctrl-V=, =Ctrl-A=,
=Ctrl-S=). You'll soon get to them. Just don't use them just yet.

Remember, if stuck, =Ctrl-G=.

** Emacs Lingo
Get familiar with the Emacs parlance. We will use it from now on:

| Original form                                     | In Emacs lingo       | Notes                                             |
|---------------------------------------------------+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------|
| =Alt-X=                                           | =M-x=                | Pronounced *Meta X*                               |
| =Ctrl-G=                                          | =C-g=                |                                                   |
| Hit =Alt-X=, type =dired-jump=, then hit =Return= | =M-x dired-jump RET= |                                                   |
| Shortcut                                          | Key Binding          |                                                   |
| Displayed content                                 | Buffer               | Any content, even if not displayed, is "a buffer" |
| To open a file                                    | To visit a file      |                                                   |
