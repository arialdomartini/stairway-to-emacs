* Vundo Child
Basically, the way undo works in normal editors is:

For each change, a state is recorded in some internal structure:

#+begin_src
s1 --> s2 --> s3 --> s4 --> s5
#+end_src

You can undo by /going back in time/, say to =s2=:

#+begin_src
s1 --> s2 --> s3 --> s4 --> s5
        |
        undo reinstating this
#+end_src

You are still able to /move forward in time/ (in a sense, undoing
   the undo):

#+begin_src
s1 --> s2 --> s3 --> s4 --> s5
               |
               undo reinstating this
#+end_src

But as soon as you make a modification, you break the undo history:

#+begin_src
s1 --> s2 --> s3 ~~> s4 ~~> s5  // oh no! This branch is gone
                \
                 sx --> sy
#+end_src
   
** And Emacs?
Emacs won't delete this branch. \\
It undoes by appending new operations. So, if this is your undo history:

#+begin_src
s1 --> s2 --> s3 --> s4 --> s5
#+end_src


undoing up to =s2= means restoring =s4=, =s3= and =s2= /re-appending
them to the history/:


#+begin_src
s1 --> s2 --> s3 --> s4 --> s5
                              \
                               `--> s4 --> s3 --> s2
#+end_src

So, if you make changes from there, no information will be lost:


#+begin_src
s1 --> s2 --> s3 --> s4 --> s5
                              \
                               `--> s4 --> s3 --> s2 --> sx  --> sy 
#+end_src


Fine. But as an editor user, this does not look very convenient, does
it?

** Gimme branches!
Wouldn't it be wonderful if Emacs just offered you an undo tree
displayed as:

#+begin_src
s1 --> s2 --> s3 --> s4 --> s5
               \
                sx --> sy
#+end_src

for you to freely browse?

Enter =vundo=. \\
It is a little built-in package that builds on top of the native
Emacs' appending-undo to provide you with a Git-like undo
functionality.

Add this to your init file:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package vundo
  :config
  (setq vundo-glyph-alist vundo-unicode-symbols))
#+end_src elisp

(The =:config= part is for using unicode chars in the display).

Et voil√†! From now on, you can travel back and forth in time, jumping
from one branch to another, just using your arrow keys. \\
Lose your changes no more!

It's black magic voodoo, child!
