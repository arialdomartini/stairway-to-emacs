The stock Emacs UI leaves to desire. Let's improve it. Here are some
options you might use, adding them to your =init.el=:

#+begin_src elisp
;; Be brave, don't use the mouse. You need neither the toolbar
;; nor the menu bar
(tool-bar-mode -1)
(menu-bar-mode -1)

;; You will scroll with the keyboard anyway
(scroll-bar-mode -1)
(horizontal-scroll-bar-mode -1)

;; The initial splash screen is so oldish...
;; Eventually, you will replace it with a fancy dashboard
(setq inhibit-splash-screen t)

;; -1 for non-blinking cursor; t for blinking
(blink-cursor-mode -1)

;; hl-line highlights the current line
(use-package hl-line
  :ensure nil             ; it's built-in
  :config
  (global-hl-line-mode)   ; this enables it everywhere

;; For smooth scrolling
(pixel-scroll-precision-mode)

;; ef-themes is a package containing nice Emacs themes by Prot
(use-package ef-themes
  :config
  (load-theme 'ef-elea-dark :no-confirm))

;; Set the main font
(set-frame-font "Monoid 18" nil t)  ; choose your poison
#+end_src

Notice how some configurations either:

- Set a variable using the =(setq variable-name value)= syntax.
- Run a command, like =(scroll-bar-mode -1)= using the syntax
  =(function-name arg1 arg2 ...)=.
- Rely on =use-package= to install extra packages.

  
Save the file (=C-x C-s=) and evaluate it (=M-x eval-buffer RET=).

A bit better, right?

Browse other themes with =M-x consult-theme RET=: it provides a
real-time preview.
